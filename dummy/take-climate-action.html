<p>The clock is ticking on our chance to stop  <strong>climate breakdown </strong>.
</p>
<p>Climate breakdown is already intensifying hurricanes, fires and droughts around the world, while causing increased flooding and heatwaves in the UK.
</p>
<p>But urgent action can still reduce the damage â€“ and  make warm homes, clean air, green jobs and thriving wildlife available to everyone.</p>
<p>Millions of people across the world are doing something about it: from young people leading protests, to the rise of clean, affordable community energy. Will you join
  them? Please ask the governments to take urgent climate action and:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Scrap climate-wrecking projects </strong> like airport expansion and new roads </li>
  <li>Unleash local climate action by giving councils the money and powers they need</li>
  <li>Pay our fair share to  <strong>help vulnerable countries</strong> and stop funding oil and gas overseas</li>
  <li>Create hundreds of thousands of good  <strong>green jobs </strong></li>
  <li>Insulate every home to  <strong>cut emissions </strong> and end fuel poverty</li>
  <li>Double  <strong>tree cover </strong> to tackle climate breakdown and support nature</li>
</ul>
