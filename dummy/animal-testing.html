<p>Hundreds of companies are  <strong>non cruelty-free </strong> and keep testing on animals and abusing them.</p>
<p>Each year, more than  <strong>100 million </strong> animals—including mice, rats, frogs, dogs, cats, rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs, monkeys, fish, and birds— <strong>are killed </strong> in U.S.
   laboratories for biology lessons, medical training, curiosity-driven experimentation, and chemical, drug, food, and cosmetics testing. Before their deaths,
   some are forced to  <strong>inhale toxic fumes </strong>, others are immobilized in restraint devices for hours, some have holes drilled into their skulls, and others have their
   skin  <strong>burned off </strong> or their spinal cords crushed. In addition to the torment of the actual experiments, animals in laboratories are deprived of everything that is
   natural and important to them—they are confined to <strong> barren cages </strong>, socially isolated, and psychologically traumatized. The thinking, feeling animals who are used
   in experiments are treated like nothing more than disposable laboratory equipment. Most animals are <strong> euthanized </strong> after being used in an experiment.

<p>We must force all the goverments to  <strong>ban animal testing </strong> and abuse right now. Take action and sign this petition  <strong>straight away! </strong></p>
