<p>There is a silent predator in our oceans: abandoned, lost or discarded <strong>fishing gear</strong>, known as ghost gear. This type of waste can scour the ocean bottom, trap and drown marine wildlife and <strong>endanger</strong> navigation and fisher economies. Globally, <strong>66%</strong> of marine mammals, <strong>50%</strong> of seabirds and all sea turtles species have been impacted by marine debris, including ghost gear.</p>
<p>Let's stop plastics choking our oceans, and harming people and nature! We urgently need a global legally binding agreement that involves every country in  <strong>ending this crisis</strong>.</p>
<p>We are calling the goverments, fishing gear designers and producers, fishers and the public to tackle the problem of ghost gear and stop our <strong>oceans drowing</strong> in plastic</p>
<p><strong>Take action</strong> now by signing this petition!</p>
