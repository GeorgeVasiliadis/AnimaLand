  <h2>Today's Threats</h2>
<p> Human activity is a major threat to the planet's biodiversity. This is because human population growth thus far has been exponential, meaning that its growth rate stays the same regardless of population size.Unfortunatly, the human impact has unpleasant concequences.</p>

<h3> Pollution</h3>
<p>
  Pollution can occur from the run off or disposal of chemical substances, or from energy sources .Many things that are useful to people produce pollution.<img class="imageright" src="https://images2.storyjumper.com/transcoder.png?trim&id=ey-iiqbsch6f-5bzqm9mu7&maxw=512&maxh=512" alt="pollution">
   Cars spew pollutants from their exhaust pipes. Industries and homes generate garbage and sewage that can pollute the land and water.
   The major kinds of pollution, usually classified by environment, are:
   <br>
     <p> <span style="font-weight:900">Air pollution:</span>is a mixture of solid particles and gases in the air. Car emissions, chemicals from factories, dust, pollen and mold spores may be suspended as particles.
     Some air pollutants are poisonous. Inhaling them can increase the chance you'll have health problems.<p>
    <p> <span style="font-weight:900">Water pollution:</span> can be caused in a number of ways, one of the most polluting being city sewage and industrial waste discharge. This degrades the quality of water.</p>

    <p> <span style="font-weight:900">Land pollution:</span> is anything that damages or contaminates the land.Land pollution, in other words, means degradation or destruction of the Earth’s surface and soil, directly or indirectly, as a result of human activities.</p>
  <p>Modern society is also concerned about specific types of pollutants, such as noise pollution, light pollution, and plastic pollution. Pollution of all kinds can have negative effects on the environment and wildlife and often impacts human health and well-being.</p></br>
</p>

<br>
<h3>Introduced species </h3>
<p>  Humans may unintentionally, or intentionally, introduce a non-native species into an ecosystem. <img class="imageleft" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2018/12/30041613/invasive-species-plants-animals.jpg" alt="introduced species">
  This can negatively effect an ecosystem because the introduced species may outcompete native organisms and displace them.
  nvasive species cause harm to wildlife in many ways. When a new and aggressive species is introduced into an ecosystem, it may not have any natural predators or controls. It can breed and spread quickly, taking over an area. Native wildlife may not have evolved defenses against the invader, or they may not be able to compete with a species that has no predators.However, other introduced species may have no negative effect or only minor impact .

<h3> Genetic Modification</h3>
<p> <img class="imageright1" src="https://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145376764576289.jpg?fit=crop&crop=faces" alt="Genetic Modification"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx953M-tpp4">Genetic Modification</a>  is a technique to change the characteristics of a plant, animal or micro-organism by transferring a piece of DNA from one organism to a different organism.
  This is done through targeted removal of the desired genes from the DNA of one organism and adding them to the other organism. Recently developed techniques for modifying genes are often called “gene editing.”The use of genetic modified organisms, or GMOs, has played an important role in increasing crop yields so we can feed our populations. In addition to providing better crop yields, modified plants are better able to resist disease and parasites, tolerate more extreme temperatures, or thrive with less water.</p>

<h3>Deforestation-Desertification </h3>
<p> <img class="imageleft1" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/09/27/15/29/forestry-960806_1280.jpg" alt="deforestation">Deforestation and desertification caused by human activities and climate change – pose major challenges to sustainable development and have affected the lives and livelihoods of millions of people. Forests are vitally important for sustaining life on Earth, and play a major role in the fight against climate change. And investing in land restoration is critical for improving livelihoods, reducing vulnerabilities, and reducing risks for the economy.For every corn field you see, chances are good there was once a forest in its place. As our population continues to increase, humans create more and larger farms, which means removing the dwindling number of forests. Forests are also cleared for the lumber that we use to build our houses and to make room for new houses.

<img class="imageright" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/03/24/05/10/tropical-4962783_1280.jpg" alt="desertification">

</p>

 <p><span style="font-weight:900">Deforestation:</span>After oceans, forests are the largest storehouses of carbon. But we're losing forests at an alarming rate.
   Over 43 million hectares, an area roughly the size of Morocco, was lost in these 'deforestation fronts' between 2004 and 2017.

Deforestation puts human health and the health of our planet at risk. From policymakers to companies to consumers, urgent action is needed to halt forest loss.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:900">Desertification:</span>
 The risk of desertification is widespread and spans more than 100 countries, humans are driving the transformation of drylands into desert on an unprecedented scale around the world.
More than 75 percent of Earth's land area is already degraded, according to the European Commission's World Atlas of Desertification, and more than 90 percent could become degraded by 2050.

<h3> Diseases</h3>
<img class="imageright1" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/06/16/16/00/people-5306374_1280.png" alt="disease">
 <p>The health of our planet also plays an important role in the emergence of zoonotic diseases, i.e. diseases that are transmissible between animals and humans. As we continue to encroach on fragile ecosystems, we bring humans into ever-greater contact with wildlife, enabling pathogens in wildlife to spill over to livestock and humans, increasing the risk of disease emergence and amplification.

   The COVID-19 outbreak highlights the need to address threats to ecosystems and wildlife.


   In 2016, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) flagged a worldwide increase in zoonotic epidemics as an issue of concern. Specifically, it pointed out that 75 per cent of all emerging infectious diseases in humans are zoonotic and that these zoonotic diseases are closely interlinked with the health of ecosystems.

   “In COVID-19, the planet has delivered its strongest warning to date that humanity must change,”<a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/unep-steps-work-zoonotics-protecting-environment-reduce-pandemic">said UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen.</a>
