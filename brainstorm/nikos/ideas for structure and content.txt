ideas for structure and content

Main page:

Up to bottom structure with images in large sizes with titles on them and below, some content with extra photos on the side 

∙Sign in/signup page
∙The welcome page is not the sign in page (but there is a tab/choice for it)
∙Some tabs on the top (goals, issues, extra content, statistics, about, what is)
∙Interactive images with titles and while scrolling down, some general content as photos (gallery), some threats or effects
∙At the bottom of the page, the logo of our organization and communication info

For the main structure and layout of the page I suggest to follow these websites:

https://www.nationalgeographic.org/
https://www.bbcearth.com/
https://onetreeplanted.org/

Keep these sites on mind not only for the structure but for information and content later on.
