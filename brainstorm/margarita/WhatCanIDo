           <h2>Reduce, reuse and recycle</h2>
    <p>A simple way to protect the environment is by recycling, reducing your waste and consumption, and reuse your stuff. You can achieve that by:
      <ul>
        <li>Replacing one use plastic objects with reusable ones such as cups, straws, bags, forks, knifes, plates made out of paper, glass, metal and natural ingredients.</li>
        <li>Fix your broken stuff and don’t throw it away immediately. Keep using stuff as long as you can.</li>
        <li>Start recycling everything you can and in the right way. For example, batteries and electronic devices are being recycled separately from other materials.</li>
        <li>Buy second hand and don’t support large fashion companies and industries. The fashion industry produces 10% of all humanity's carbon emissions, is the second-largest consumer of the world's water supply.</li></ul>

          <h2>Use public transport, bike and walking</h2>
          <p> Private vehicles such as cars are one of the <a href="https://sciencing.com/effects-car-pollutants-environment-23581.html">biggest causes of air pollution</a>, something that affects farming, water quality, human health, natural landscapes, wildlife and sea levels. What we can do is take the public transport more (bus, metro, train) , walk more, use our bike to move around, share our car and choose a car that consumes less energy. That will definitely make as healthier, happier and save some money too!</p>

         <h2>Change the way you eat</h2>
         <p>We are what we eat! , they say. So we should be selective with our food. The food industry has a considerable impact on the environment. Food production contributes, for example, to climate change, eutrophication and acid rain, as well as the depletion of biodiversity. It is also a considerable drain on other resources, such as nutrients, land area, energy, and water. What we should do is: <ul>
         <li> Eat less meal and diary products. Meat and diary production is responsible for 14% of global climate-changing emissions.</li>
         <li>Buy local products and support local producers and farmers.</li>
         <li>Don't waste food for no reason.</li>
         <li>Grow your own food such as vegetables, fruits, nuts etc. by planting seeds in your garden.</li></ul>

         <h2>Save energy and water</h2>
         <p> Reducing energy and water use limits the number of carbon emissions in the environment and produces a higher quality of life. Reduced emissions result in cleaner air quality. Also, it helps create a healthier planet, or at least helps sustain the resources we already have. After all it helps us save our money. All we have to do is:<ul>
         <li>Turn off the lights, turn off and unplug the devices when we don't need them.</li>
         <li>Take short showers instead of long baths.</li>
         <li>Turn off the tap when we are brushing our teeth or doing the dishes.</li>
         <li>When buying new devices choose the ones that consume less energy.</li>
         <li>Replace our energy at home with renewable sources of energy such us aeolian, solar power or put some photovoltaics. </li> </ul>
