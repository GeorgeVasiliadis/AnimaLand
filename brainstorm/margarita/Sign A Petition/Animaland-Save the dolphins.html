	  <p>Every year, in Taiji, Japan, dolphins are chased into a small cove and butchered in the most horrific and cruel way imaginable.
	     The hunts are subsidized by the dolphin captivity industry, which pays top dollar for a few “show quality” dolphins that are ripped from their families.
	     The rest of the pod is killed for meat laden with mercury and PCBs. Most Japanese don’t even know the hunts exist. The Japanese government supports the dolphin
		 killers and denies any health issues. 
	  </p>
      <p>On September 1st, the Taiji dolphin hunters once again opened the annual dolphin-hunting season, with the banger boats heading out to the ocean daily for the 
	     next six months.  Four bottlenose dolphins were captured on the first day of the season, all of which were put in slings and carried off to the Taiji Whale Museum 
	     for a lifetime of small tanks and eating dead fish.</p>

      <p>When they succeed in finding a dolphin pod, the hunters will herd the dolphins into the notorious Cove by use of poles stuck into the water and banged on by hammers,
	     producing a wall of sound.  The frightened dolphins in the Cove are then surrounded by nets, where representatives of captive dolphin facilities and international 
	     dolphin brokers will choose a few to grab for a lifetime of captivity.</p>

      <p>The rest – females, males and calves – are usually slaughtered in a welter of blood.</p>

      <p>Occasionally, the hunters will herd some of the dolphins back to the ocean, where the traumatized individuals face a hard recovery and are unlikely to survive.  
	     This often happens with “surplus” bottlenose dolphins, which are more highly prized for captivity than other species and are showing signs of depletion due to 
		 the Taiji killings.
	  </p>
	  <p>The quotas issued by the Japanese government for the 2020-21 hunt season are the same as last season’s numbers. These include <strong>1,749</strong> individual 
	     dolphins of nine different species.
