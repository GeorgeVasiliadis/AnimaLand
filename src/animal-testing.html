	  <p>Hundreds of companies are non cruelty-free and keep testing on animals and abusing them. 
	  </p>
      </p>Most animals are euthanized after being used in an experiment.
		  Each year, more than 100 million animals—including mice, rats, frogs, dogs, cats, rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs, monkeys, fish, and birds—are killed in U.S.
		  laboratories for biology lessons, medical training, curiosity-driven experimentation, and chemical, drug, food, and cosmetics testing. Before their deaths,
		  some are forced to inhale toxic fumes, others are immobilized in restraint devices for hours, some have holes drilled into their skulls, and others have their
		  skin burned off or their spinal cords crushed. In addition to the torment of the actual experiments, animals in laboratories are deprived of everything that is 
		  natural and important to them—they are confined to barren cages, socially isolated, and psychologically traumatized. The thinking, feeling animals who are used 
		  in experiments are treated like nothing more than disposable laboratory equipment. Most animals are euthanized after being used in an experiment.
	  </p>
	  <p>We must force all the goverments to ban animal testing and abuse right now. Take action and sign this petition straight away!</p><br>
