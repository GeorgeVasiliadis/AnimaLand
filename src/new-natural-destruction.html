            <p>On February 23, the Ministry for Development and Investment introduced to Hellenic Parliament a  <strong>new bill </strong> entitled "Modernization, simplification and reform of
              the regulatory framework of public procurement, specific regulations for procurement in the fields of defense and security and other provisions for development
              and infrastructure".
            </p>
            <p>Signed by the Minister for Development (Adonis Georgiadis) and also by the Minister for the Environment and Energy (Costas Skrekas), the bill includes a provision
              that gradually  <strong>undermines the protection of Natura </strong> 2000 sites and leads to their fragmentation, as smaller areas are designated for the development of investment projects.
            </p>
            <p>We are asking from the Greek MPs to immediately withdraw <strong>Article 219</strong> because:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>It leads to the  <strong>fragmentation </strong> of protected areas by isolating parts of them based on vague investment criteria and not their environmental needs and requirements.</li>
              <li>It ignores the recent conviction of Greece by the Court of Justice of the  <strong>European Union </strong> for failure to comply with the Habitats Directive.</li>
              <li>It attempts to circumvent the EU Pilot process recently initiated by the European Commission for inadequate implementation of significant legal obligations to prevent  <strong>degradation of Natura </strong> 2000 sites.</li>
              <li>It  <strong>undermines the country's prospects </strong> for sustainable development.</li>
