            <p> A simple way to protect the environment is by recycling, reducing your waste and consumption, and reuse your stuff. You can achieve that by:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Replacing one use plastic objects with reusable ones such as cups, straws, bags, forks, knifes, plates made out of paper, glass, metal and natural ingredients.</li>
              <li>Fix your broken stuff and don’t throw it away immediately. Keep using stuff as long as you can.</li>
              <li>Start recycling everything you can and in the right way. For example, batteries and electronic devices are being recycled separately from other materials.</li>
              <li>Buy second hand and don’t support large fashion companies and industries. The fashion industry produces 10% of all humanity's carbon emissions, is the second-largest consumer of the world's water supply.</li>

            <h3 class="py-2">Use public transport, bike and walking</h3>
            <p> Private vehicles such as cars are one of the <a href="https://sciencing.com/effects-car-pollutants-environment-23581.html">biggest causes of air pollution</a>, something that affects farming, water quality, human health, natural landscapes, wildlife and sea levels.
              What we can do is take the public transport more (bus, metro, train) , walk more, use our bike to move around, share our car and choose a car that consumes less energy. That will definitely make as healthier, happier and save some money too!

            <h3 class="py-2">Change the way you eat</h3>
            <p> We are what we eat! , they say. So we should be selective with our food. The food industry has a considerable impact on the environment. Food production contributes,
              for example, to climate change, eutrophication and acid rain, as well as the depletion of biodiversity. It is also a considerable drain on other resources, such as nutrients, land area, energy, and water. What we should do is:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Eat less meal and diary products. Meat and diary production is responsible for 14% of global climate-changing emissions.</li>
              <li>Buy local products and support local producers and farmers.</li>
              <li>Don't waste food for no reason.</li>
              <li>Grow your own food such as vegetables, fruits, nuts etc. by planting seeds in your garden.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="py-2">Save energy and water</h3>
            <p> Reducing energy and water use limits the number of carbon emissions in the environment and produces a higher quality of life. Reduced emissions result
              in cleaner air quality. Also, it helps create a healthier planet, or at least helps sustain the resources we already have. After all it helps us save our money. All we have to do is:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Turn off the lights, turn off and unplug the devices when we don't need them.</li>
              <li>Take short showers instead of long baths.</li>
              <li>Turn off the tap when we are brushing our teeth or doing the dishes.</li>
              <li>When buying new devices choose the ones that consume less energy.</li>
              <li>Replace our energy at home with renewable sources of energy such us aeolian, solar power or put some photovoltaics. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="py-2">Protect the forests</h3>
            <p> The equivalent to 1 football pitch of forest is lost every second. Annually, WWF estimates that around 8 million hectares of forest are lost, and as a result,
              17% of the Amazonian forest has been lost over the last 50 years, together with other forestal areas in Indonesia or Congo. It's your responsibility to save our forests and
              some ways to achieve that are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use tree-free products such as bamboo products, bamboo paper towels, toothbrushes and toilet paper. </li>
              <li>Buy rain forest alliance certified products which support sustainable forest management and allow forest-reliant communities to thrive.</li>
              <li>Plant a tree - According to the National Wildlife Federation, just one tree will absorb more than one ton of carbon dioxide in its lifetime.
                That’s equivalent to more than 2,000 miles driven by the average car.
              </li>
              <li>Enjoy forests responsibly. Going out into nature and enjoying our forests for yourself is a big part of learning how to save trees.</li>
              <li>Don't waste unecessary paper and use both sides of paper</li>
            </ul>

            <p> The best way to help with making a change in the world is by taking action. There are hundreds of organizations out there who need your help and support. By volunteering
              not only you will contribute to their hard work but you will also feel happy, grateful and fulfil. Whenever you can donate some money to these organizations because that is
              very important for them to keep acting. Team work makes the dream work!

            <p> It would be awesome if you could get others involved in this journey too. Try to inform your friends about what's going on in our planet right now, about the threats
              it has to deal with and about how important it is to take action and change our world. You can start a project with them or do actions like cleaning a park or a beach and go
              to protests. Spread this issue among your friends, family, and community and manage to inspire them.
